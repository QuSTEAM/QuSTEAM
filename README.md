# QuSTEAM
## About Us
QuSTEAM is a nonprofit network of colleges, universities, and employers that collaborate to scale quantum information science and engineering (**QISE**) to diverse institutions to achieve a diverse workforce. We offer tools for evidence-based STEM education. QuSTEAM aims to make it easier for 2- and 4-year institutions to develop undergraduate QISE (quantum information science and engineering) course sequences and research programs to build a quantum minor.

## About QuSTEAM on GitHub
QuSTEAM hosts repositories for teaching materials organized into eight courses and instructor resources. These repositories are shared within an organization. If you an instructor at a QuSTEAM-affiliated insitution or company,  and would like to access to course materials via gitHub, report your GitHub username on the [Instructor and SME registration](https://forms.gle/NexZRYMWkhJJcnh88) Sample syllabi and materials will be available in a public repository as well.

Repositories:
* Qu0-Instructor-Resources

* Qu1-Quantum-Revolution

* Qu2-Classical-and-Quantum-Logic

* Qu3-Math-Methods-for-QISE

* Qu4-Quantum-Lab

* Qu5-Discipline-based-Quantum-Mechanics

* Qu6-Quantum-Mechanics-for-QISE

* Qu7-Quantum-Software

* Qu8-Quantum-Hardware
