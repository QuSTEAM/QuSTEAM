# QuSTEAM
## About Us
QuSTEAM is a nonprofit network of colleges, universities, and employers that collaborate to scale quantum information science and engineering (**QISE**) to diverse institutions to achieve a diverse workforce. We offer tools for evidence-based STEM education. QuSTEAM aims to make it easier for 2- and 4-year institutions to develop undergraduate QISE (quantum information science and engineering) course sequences and research programs to build a quantum minor.

## About QuSTEAM on GitHub
QuSTEAM hosts repositories for teaching materials organized into eight courses and instructor resources. These materials are available through four platforms:

* qBraid - execute programs on quantum processors built on a variety of qubit types
* Canvas - deliver material to students
* Google Drive - access, contribute, revise, comment on course documents
* GitHub - version control, backup, refresh

Although each platform was included for the reasons stated, faculty can use each platform to access disseminated teaching materials.
Faculty can also use each platform to contribute to the crowdsourcing effort aiming to improve, synthesize, disseminate, and facilitate evaluation of 
methods and materials for building undergraduate capacity for undergraduate QISE instruction and research. Material is provided for use in in-person teaching at QuSTEAM member institutions after review and revision from subject matter expertise across diverse disciplines. The review process includes review ascertaining support for evidence-based pedagogy. Materials must state learning outcomes front and center, in front of students, aligned to an assessment that engages students to demonstrate desired skills and knowledge. 

Sample syllabus and material will be available by course, hosted in this public repository:

* Qu0-Instructor-Resources

* Qu1-Quantum-Revolution

* Qu2-Classical-and-Quantum-Logic

* Qu3-Math-Methods-for-QISE

* Qu4-Quantum-Lab

* Qu5-Discipline-based-Quantum-Mechanics

* Qu6-Quantum-Mechanics-for-QISE

* Qu7-Quantum-Software

* Qu8-Quantum-Hardware
